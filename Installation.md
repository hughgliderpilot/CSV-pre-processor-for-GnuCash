## Installation and Run Instructions

There is no automatic installation. 

I tried to make it run from right-clicking the transaction file and then have csv_for_GnuCash as an option, this can be done if you compile the code with something like Pyinstaller and then associate the Python module csv_pre_processor_for GnuCash.exe with .CSV files so it opens the programmer when you right click on your CSV file downloaded from the bank with the transactions.  (See detailed instructions on how to do this below. )

Otherwise just run from a Python 3 command line.
